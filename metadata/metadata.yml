name: System identification with prior knowledge on the impulse response
description: 'Subspace identification methods may produce unreliable model estimates
  when a small number of noisy measurements are available. In such cases, the accuracy
  of the estimated parameters can be improved by using prior knowledge about the system.
  We propose a method that computes a state space representation from input/output
  data of the system, using prior knowledge about the impulse response. The method
  has two steps: 1) estimation of the impulse response with linear equality and inequality
  constraints, and 2) realization of the estimated impulse response. In the case of
  prior knowledge expressed as equality constraints, the problem on step 1 admits
  a closed form solution.'
